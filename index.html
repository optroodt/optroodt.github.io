            <p>I, Youri op 't Roodt, used to play Mega Man 2 and the other games from the series when I was a kid. The release of the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/" target="_blank">NES Mini Classic</a> edition, <a href="http://www.analogue.co/pages/nt-mini" target="_blank">Analogue Nt mini</a> and the <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=36&products_id=78" target="_blank">RetroUSB AVS</a> sparked my interest in NES games again. Mega Man 2 is included as one of the games on the NES Mini Classic.</p>
            <p>The password scheme for all of the Mega Man games have long been documented, but I just wanted write my own implementation and create a nice user interface using JavaScript and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>. If you want to read more about it, all the sources (including a Python implementation of the scheme) are available on GitHub.</p>
